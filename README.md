# Blockchain

This project creates a Blockchain miner that does all the following:

•	Receives transactions from user or remote node.
•	Sends transactions to a remote node.
•	Manages incoming remote node messages using a Queue.
•	Generates a Merkle Tree and an eventual Merkle Root as part of transaction processing.
•	Creates Blockchain Blocks using Proof of Work algorithm.

The project will involve the following:
- Socket programming
- Queue
- Multithreading
- Hashing: SHA-256
- Merkle Trees
- Blockchain Proof of Work

##### Note: This app doesn’t save the blocks into a blockchain, but the central functionality my code will be able to be plugged in directly into a larger Blockchain application that fully manages a Blockchain, connects to multiple networked nodes, and allows us to trade items on the network.
